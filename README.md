The system has three sensors, namely Vibration sensor, Water sensor, and IR sensor. Firstly, the sensors are selected to analyze the bridge parameters. A vibration sensor (SW 420) is used to detect the vibrations, water sensor is used to measure the level of water below the bridge in case of water bridges and IR sensor is used as tachometer to detect the high wind speed. All the sensors are interfaced on the Arduino Uno R3 depending on whether the sensors used have analog or digital output. The output components used are LCD and servo motor. The
code is compiled on Arduino IDE and uploaded to the Arduino Uno R3. The system is placed on the bridge prototype made with the sensors at appropriate positions and the output for each
sensor is checked. Initially, the LCD will display the default message "Happy Journey Safe to Go"
